# Vendor Management Policy

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-18  
**Owner:** Security Team  

## Purpose

This policy establishes the requirements for evaluating, onboarding, monitoring, and offboarding third-party vendors to ensure they meet the organizationâ€™s security, privacy, and compliance expectations.

Effective vendor management helps reduce risk from external service providers, especially those that handle sensitive company or customer data.

## Scope

This policy applies to:
- All third-party vendors, suppliers, partners, and contractors who access, process, or store company information.
- All departments responsible for engaging or managing vendor relationships.

## Policy

### 1. **Vendor Classification**
- Vendors must be classified based on the **criticality and sensitivity** of the services or data involved:
  - **Tier 1:** Vendors with access to sensitive or production data
  - **Tier 2:** Vendors supporting critical infrastructure or systems
  - **Tier 3:** Vendors with no access to sensitive data or systems

### 2. **Vendor Risk Assessment**
- A **security risk assessment** must be completed before engaging any Tier 1 or Tier 2 vendor.
- The assessment includes:
  - Security posture evaluation (SOC 2, ISO 27001, questionnaires)
  - Data handling practices
  - Subprocessor relationships (if applicable)
- Results must be reviewed and approved by the Security Team.

### 3. **Due Diligence and Contractual Requirements**
- All Tier 1 vendors must sign a **Data Processing Agreement (DPA)** or equivalent.
- Contracts must include:
  - Confidentiality and data protection clauses
  - Breach notification timelines (e.g., within 72 hours)
  - Audit rights for compliance verification

### 4. **Onboarding**
- Vendors must be onboarded using a standardized process that includes:
  - Completion of a security questionnaire (e.g., CAIQ, VSA)
  - Assignment of a vendor owner from the business unit
  - Documentation of systems/data the vendor will access

### 5. **Ongoing Monitoring**
- Security and performance of critical vendors must be reviewed at least **annually**.
- Reviews include:
  - Changes in control environment (e.g., updated SOC 2 reports)
  - Data breach or incident history
  - Re-evaluation of vendor classification
- Vendors not meeting requirements must be remediated or offboarded.

### 6. **Access Management**
- Vendors must only be given the minimum necessary access.
- Vendor accounts must be:
  - Approved, documented, and time-bound
  - Reviewed quarterly by the vendor owner
  - Immediately deactivated when no longer needed

### 7. **Incident Management**
- Vendors must notify the company immediately in the event of a suspected or actual data breach.
- Incident response expectations must be documented in the contract.

### 8. **Offboarding**
- Upon termination, vendor access must be removed within **24 hours**.
- All company data must be returned or securely deleted as documented.
- Offboarding activities must be verified and recorded.
