# markdown-policies
This is a repo that can be cloned to be used by organizations who need a base set of policies to help stand up their security and compliance program. 

Please note: These policies should not be used 'as-is' to govern your organization's operations. This is designed to be used as a way to get a base set of policy templates for your organization and then tailor the policies to your organization's needs.
