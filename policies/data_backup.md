# Data Backup Policy

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-18  
**Owner:** Security Team  

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to define requirements for backing up critical data and systems to ensure business continuity, data availability, and integrity in the event of system failure, data corruption, or security incidents such as ransomware.

This policy supports compliance with SOC 2 and ISO/IEC 27001 standards.

## Scope

This policy applies to:
- All production systems, services, databases, and data stores containing Confidential or Restricted information
- All teams and personnel responsible for infrastructure, data storage, or business continuity
- All backup environments and storage media

## Policy

### 1. **Backup Coverage**

- All critical production systems, including databases, file systems, and configurations, must be backed up regularly.
- Backups must include:
  - System and application configurations
  - Customer and operational data
  - Encryption keys and certificates (with additional controls)
- Systems storing or processing Confidential or Restricted data must have backup plans in place.

### 2. **Backup Frequency**

- **Critical systems and databases**: Full backups must occur at least **daily**, with incremental backups as needed.
- **Non-critical systems**: Backups must occur at least **weekly** or based on recovery time objectives (RTO).
- Backup frequency must be documented and meet defined business continuity and recovery requirements.

### 3. **Backup Retention**

- Backups must be retained according to data classification and regulatory requirements:
  - **Restricted/Confidential data**: Minimum retention of **90 days**
  - **Audit and compliance backups**: Retention of **1 year or more**, as required
- Backup retention schedules must be defined and documented in a backup plan.

### 4. **Encryption and Security**

- All backups must be encrypted at rest using strong encryption (e.g., AES-256).
- Backups transmitted over networks must be encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2 or higher.
- Access to backup data must be limited to authorized personnel and monitored.

### 5. **Backup Storage and Redundancy**

- Backups must be stored in geographically separate locations or across availability zones.
- At least one backup copy must be stored offsite or in a cloud provider with high availability guarantees.
- Backup storage must support redundancy and fault tolerance.

### 6. **Testing and Restoration**

- Backup restoration tests must be conducted **at least quarterly** to validate the integrity and usability of backup data.
- Tests must include:
  - Full restoration of systems or data
  - Logging of test results
  - Documentation of restoration times vs. RTO/RPO targets
- Any failures must be addressed immediately and retested.

### 7. **Monitoring and Reporting**

- All backup jobs must be monitored for completion, errors, and integrity.
- Failed backup jobs must trigger alerts to the appropriate team.
- Backup activity logs must be retained and reviewed periodically.

### 8. **Roles and Responsibilities**

- The Security Team is responsible for defining backup policy and oversight.
- The Infrastructure or DevOps Team is responsible for implementing and testing backup solutions.
- Application owners must identify data requiring backup and work with infrastructure teams to ensure coverage.
