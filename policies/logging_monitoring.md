# Logging and Monitoring Policy

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-18  
**Owner:** Security Team  

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to define the logging and monitoring standards necessary to detect, investigate, and respond to security threats and operational issues. Proper logging and active monitoring are essential for maintaining situational awareness, enabling incident response, and meeting compliance obligations.

This policy supports compliance with SOC 2 and ISO/IEC 27001 standards.

## Scope

This policy applies to:
- All production systems, applications, services, and networks
- All employees, contractors, and third-party service providers responsible for managing infrastructure or applications
- All environments that process, store, or transmit Confidential or Restricted data

## Policy

### 1. **Logging Requirements**

All critical systems must generate logs that capture the following types of events:

- **Authentication and Access Events**
  - Successful and failed login attempts
  - Privileged user access
  - User account changes or lockouts

- **System Events**
  - Process start/stop
  - System restarts or crashes
  - Configuration or software changes

- **Network Events**
  - Firewall and VPN connections
  - Ingress/egress traffic patterns
  - DNS queries (where appropriate)

- **Application Events**
  - User actions within applications handling sensitive data
  - Failed transactions or errors
  - Changes to data or configurations

- **Security Events**
  - Malware detections
  - Intrusion attempts
  - Unauthorized access attempts or policy violations

### 2. **Log Format and Integrity**

- Logs must be timestamped using synchronized system clocks (e.g., via NTP).
- Logs must include user IDs, source IP addresses, and other context where applicable.
- Logs must be **immutable** and **tamper-evident** (e.g., write-once storage, hashing).
- Logs must be stored in a centralized logging platform (e.g., SIEM, cloud-native tools).

### 3. **Log Retention**

- Logs related to security events and system access must be retained for **at least 1 year**.
- Retention may be longer depending on regulatory or business requirements.
- Archived logs must be protected with encryption and access controls.

### 4. **Monitoring and Alerting**

- All critical logs must be continuously monitored for signs of:
  - Unauthorized access
  - System failures
  - Anomalous user behavior
  - Malware or intrusion activity

- Alerts must be generated and routed to the Security or Operations team based on severity.
- Alert thresholds and response actions must be defined in the Incident Response Plan.

### 5. **Review and Analysis**

- Security logs must be reviewed at least **weekly** for:
  - Indicators of compromise
  - Policy violations
  - Misconfigurations or operational anomalies

- Automated tools (e.g., SIEM rules, machine learning models) may be used to assist in log analysis.
- All alerts and responses must be documented and tracked.

### 6. **Third-Party and Cloud Services**

- Cloud providers must support exporting logs relevant to security and compliance.
- Third-party vendors handling critical operations must provide logs or attestations of monitoring as part of due diligence.

### 7. **Access to Logs**

- Access to logs must be restricted to authorized personnel only.
- Access must be granted based on job function and approved by Security or Engineering leadership.
- All access to log data must itself be logged and monitored.
